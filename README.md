# thm
TryHackMe Kali

Python CLI for TryHackMe Kali management

```
pip3 install thm
```

Installs the client

```
thm brandonskerritt/scripts
```

Loads the scripts repo

The scripts repo is a template repo, I should make this too (maybe an organisation?)

# Commands

```
thm add # adds software to the scripts part
thm brandonskerritt/scripts # git clones the repo, and installs all the scripts in scripts.sh or runs it
thm close # commits and pushes to the git repo
```

# Template repo
Need a template repo so people cna fork it and copy it. Must have scripts in root, and folders for notes.
