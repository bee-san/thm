# thm
TryHackMe Kali

Python CLI for TryHackMe Kali management

```
pip3 install thm
```

Installs the client

```
thm brandonskerritt/scripts
```

Loads the scripts repo

The scripts repo is a template repo, I should make this too (maybe an organisation?)

# Commands

```
thm add # adds software to the scripts part
thm brandonskerritt/scripts # git clones the repo, and installs all the scripts in scripts.sh or runs it
thm close # commits and pushes to the git repo
```

# Template repo
Need a template repo so people cna fork it and copy it. Must have scripts in root, and folders for notes.

# BashRC support

Appends your BASHRC to the end of the current BASHRC

# How to use
1. Fork this repository
2. Add all your notes to the `notes` folder
3. Add your favourite scripts (or leave a GitHub issue with your favourites so I can add them)

**On THM Kali**

When it boots:
1. `pip3 install thm`
2. `thm -d <username>/thm
